Data Requirements
 
You are required to choose your own data for this homework.
 
·   	Your data should not come from Kaggle, or any main data source included in term project.
·   	Your data should not be the same as your team member in your term project.
·   	Your data must contain at least 10 columns and more than 7500 rows.
·   	Your data should not contain aggregate data. However, if there is no other way, you must consult with the instructor first. 
·   	Your data should not be stock market data or bitcoin market data.
You will be using the same data for all subsequent homework. So, it is important that you take your time to choose the right data. If you want to change data at a later stage, you are free to do so. However, you will have to start the whole homework 1 and it will not be graded
